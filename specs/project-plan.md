# Diggie iOS MVP Implementation Plan

I'll create a comprehensive step-by-step implementation plan for the Diggie iOS application based on the product roadmap, project requirements, and technical specifications.

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Project Foundation**: Establish proper SwiftUI + @Observable architecture following .cursorrules
2. **Core Navigation**: Implement navigation flow between onboarding and main app
3. **Onboarding Flow**: 3-screen user validation and pricing capture system
4. **Account Management**: OAuth integration for Threads and Bluesky
5. **Content Creation**: Text editor with platform-specific character counting
6. **Cross-posting**: Single-tap publishing to multiple platforms
7. **Subscription System**: RevenueCat integration for early bird promotion
8. **Analytics Integration**: PostHog for user behavior tracking
9. **Error Handling & Accessibility**: Robust user experience
10. **Testing & Polish**: Final refinements for App Store submission

## Implementation Approach

- Each step will be atomic and focused on specific functionality
- Follow domain-driven design with proper separation of concerns
- Use @Observable pattern throughout (no ObservableObject)
- Implement comprehensive error handling and accessibility

The plan will transform the current basic SwiftUI template into a fully functional cross-platform posting application ready for App Store submission and user validation.
