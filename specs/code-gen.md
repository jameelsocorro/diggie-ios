# Diggie iOS MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview

Create a comprehensive step-by-step implementation plan for the Diggie iOS application MVP, focusing on rapid market validation with a 4-6 week timeline.

## Implementation Strategy

I'll create a detailed, sequential plan that transforms the current basic SwiftUI template into a fully functional cross-platform posting application. The plan will break down development into manageable, atomic steps following the domain-driven design structure specified in .cursorrules.

## Key Components to Implement

- [ ] **Project Foundation & Architecture**: Establish proper SwiftUI + @Observable architecture
- [ ] **Navigation System**: Type-safe navigation between onboarding and main app
- [ ] **Onboarding Flow**: 3-screen user validation and pricing capture system
- [ ] **Domain Models**: User, account, platform, and content models
- [ ] **Service Layer**: OAuth integration, API services for Threads/Bluesky
- [ ] **Content Creation Interface**: Text editor with character counting and platform toggles
- [ ] **Account Management**: Connection/disconnection of social platforms
- [ ] **Cross-posting System**: Single-tap publishing to multiple platforms
- [ ] **Settings & Preferences**: User preferences and early bird offer access
- [ ] **Error Handling & Accessibility**: Comprehensive user experience features
- [ ] **Testing & Polish**: Final refinements for App Store submission

## Output

The plan will be structured with specific, actionable steps that can be implemented sequentially. Each step will focus on specific functionality, modify a manageable number of files (â‰¤20), and build upon previous implementations. The result will be a complete implementation guide in markdown format suitable for systematic development.
