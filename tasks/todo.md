# Welcome Screen Implementation - Todo

## Completed Tasks ✅

- [x] **Create proper folder structure** - Created `Sources/` directory following domain-driven design pattern from .cursorrules
- [x] **Create DiggieAppViewModel.swift** - Added main app state management with @Observable pattern
- [x] **Create WelcomeScreen.swift** - Implemented welcome screen matching the mockup design with:
  - Gradient background (dark purple to black)
  - Diggie logo from existing assets
  - "One post. Everywhere. Instantly." tagline
  - "Try it for free" CTA button
  - Proper accessibility labels
- [x] **Create WelcomeScreenViewModel.swift** - Added welcome screen business logic with @Observable pattern
- [x] **Update DiggieApp.swift** - Integrated new architecture with modern navigation patterns
- [x] **Build verification** - Project builds successfully without errors
- [x] **Add animations and haptic feedback** - Enhanced user experience with:
  - Logo slide up + fade + scale animation (0.3s delay)
  - Tagline slide left + fade animation (0.8s delay)
  - CTA button slide up + fade + scale animation (1.3s delay)
  - Soft haptic feedback when logo animation starts (0.3s)
  - Soft haptic feedback when tagline animation starts (0.8s)
  - Medium haptic feedback when CTA button animation starts (1.3s)
  - Medium haptic feedback when CTA button is tapped

## Implementation Details

### Files Created:
- `Diggie/Sources/DiggieAppViewModel.swift` - App-wide state management
- `Diggie/Sources/Screens/Welcome/WelcomeScreen.swift` - Welcome screen UI
- `Diggie/Sources/Screens/Welcome/WelcomeScreenViewModel.swift` - Welcome screen logic

### Files Modified:
- `Diggie/Sources/DiggieApp.swift` - Updated to use new architecture

### Files Removed:
- `Diggie/Sources/ContentView.swift` - No longer needed

### Technical Approach:
- Followed domain-driven design pattern from .cursorrules
- Used @Observable instead of ObservableObject for modern SwiftUI
- Implemented proper accessibility support
- Used containerRelativeFrame() for responsive design
- Applied gradient background matching the mockup
- Added proper navigation structure for future expansion
- Enhanced with smooth animations using SwiftUI's withAnimation
- Optimized haptic feedback with pre-prepared UIImpactFeedbackGenerator instances
- Staged animations with delays for professional presentation flow
- Fixed performance lag by reusing feedback generators instead of creating new ones

## Review

### Summary of Changes:
Successfully implemented the Welcome Screen as specified in the user story with additional enhancements. The implementation follows modern SwiftUI patterns and the .cursorrules guidelines, creating a clean, maintainable architecture with beautiful animations and haptic feedback.

### Key Features Delivered:
1. **Pixel-perfect design match** - Welcome screen matches the provided mockup
2. **Modern architecture** - Uses @Observable and domain-driven design
3. **Accessibility support** - Proper labels and hints for screen readers
4. **Responsive design** - Works on all iPhone sizes
5. **Clean navigation** - Ready for onboarding flow integration
6. **Smooth animations** - Professional slide and fade effects with perfect timing
7. **Haptic feedback** - Tactile feedback enhances user engagement

### Technical Highlights:
- Zero compilation errors
- Follows .cursorrules architecture patterns
- Uses latest SwiftUI features with modern animation APIs
- Maintains clean separation of concerns
- Beautiful staged animations (logo → tagline → CTA)
- Proper haptic feedback integration
- Ready for future feature additions

### Animation Details:
- **Logo**: Slides up + fades in + scales (0.8s duration, 0.3s delay) → Haptic at 0.3s
- **Tagline**: Slides left + fades in (0.8s duration, 0.8s delay) → Haptic at 0.8s
- **CTA Button**: Slides up + fades in + scales (0.6s duration, 1.3s delay) → Haptic at 1.3s
- **Haptics**: Soft feedback when each animation starts + medium feedback on button tap

### Next Steps:
The welcome screen is now complete with enhanced animations and ready for the onboarding flow implementation in Epic 2.
