# Platform Button Screen Disappearing Issue - Investigation and Fix

## Problem Analysis
After analyzing the PlatformButton implementation and related code, I've identified the potential cause of the screen disappearing when toggling platform buttons:

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **PlatformButton Implementation**: The button itself looks fine - it just calls the action closure and provides haptic feedback
2. **PlatformSelectionScreenViewModel**: The `togglePlatform` method updates state and calls `syncWithService()`
3. **OnboardingService**: The `nextStep()` method increments `currentStep` when `canProceedFromCurrentStep` is true
4. **OnboardingFlowView**: Has an animation that transitions between screens when `onboardingService.currentStep` changes (line 77)

### The Issue:
The problem appears to be in the **OnboardingFlowView** at line 77:
```swift
.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.3), value: onboardingService.currentStep)
```

When a platform button is toggled:
1. It calls `viewModel.togglePlatform(platform)`
2. This updates `selectedPlatforms` and calls `syncWithService()`
3. The service updates its state, which might trigger reactivity
4. The animation modifier might be causing the entire view to re-render or transition unexpectedly

## Plan to Fix

### Task 1: Investigate Animation Behavior
- [ ] Review the animation modifier in OnboardingFlowView line 77
- [ ] Check if the animation is being triggered incorrectly when platform selection changes

### Task 2: Fix the Animation Issue
- [ ] Modify the animation to be more specific and only trigger on actual step changes
- [ ] Ensure platform selection updates don't cause unwanted screen transitions

### Task 3: Test the Fix
- [ ] Verify that platform button toggling no longer causes screen disappearing
- [ ] Ensure normal navigation between onboarding steps still works correctly
